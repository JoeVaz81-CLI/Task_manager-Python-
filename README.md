# Task_manager-Python-
The program is based on Python's built-in Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface, and sqlite3 library for managing tasks using a SQLite database.

Users can:

Add a new task to the task list.
View all the existing tasks.
Delete a task from the task list.

As this is a basic version of a task manager, it will be improved upon as my Python programming skills develop.

Future Users will be able to:

Allowing users to edit existing tasks.
Adding a task priority system (low, medium, high).
Adding due dates for tasks.
Adding notifications for due tasks.
Improving the interface for better user experience.
